Howdy. These are all of my side project and main projects from Angela Yu's 100 days of code. I take pride in the fact that I was able to complete these on my own without copying other peoples solutions, including Angela's. My code is not yet the most concise, but I am sure I can look back on all these projects in a few years and clean them up for fun.

You can find her course on Udemy at https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

Thanks for reading!
