This is a basic weightlifting calculator that allows you to calculate
your probable max for a lift based on weight lifted and reps performed.
The chart option takes your known max and breaks it down into percentages
so you can calculate your different lifting intensities.

I enjoyed making this code as a personal side project, and this is where I started to regularly use a list for my strings to tidy up my work.
