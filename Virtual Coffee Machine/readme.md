This is a virtual coffee machine that has to take into account money (spare change) calculation, making change from a vending machine, checking if there is enough money for the transaction, and checking if there are enough resources to make the order. Resources and money inside of the machine are updated and reflected by using the "report" feature at the menu. You may also exit from the menu. This was also used as an exercise in retrieving data from a dictionary to save time. Cheers!
